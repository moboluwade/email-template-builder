# 📧 Email Template Builder Library – Developer Guide

Build beautiful, responsive emails without touching a single `<table>`!

This is a **drag-and-drop email template builder** made for modern React apps. Drop in headers, images, buttons, and more — then export clean, email-safe HTML that works with providers like **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**, or **Postmark**.

Think of it as your no-fuss email playground — made with JavaScript, for JavaScript developers.  
Plug it into your Next.js or React app, customize blocks, and skip the headache of email formatting.

## 🚀 Features

-   ✨ **Drag-and-Drop Editor** – Intuitive interface for composing email layouts visually. Build complex structures by simply dragging blocks into place.
    
-   🧩 **Modular Block Architecture** – Includes reusable content blocks such as headers, paragraphs, images, buttons, and dividers. Easily extensible to support custom blocks.
    
-   📨 **Email-Safe HTML Export** – Outputs responsive, standards-compliant HTML that renders consistently across major email clients.
    
-   💾 **Persistent State Management** – Data is retained across sessions to avoid accidental loss during refreshes or navigation.
    
-   🔌 **Provider Integration Ready** – Designed to support adapter-based integration with popular providers like SendGrid, Mailgun, and Postmark.
    
-   🧾 **Form Builder Mode** – Leverage pre-built transactional email templates for faster setup of common use cases like password resets or notifications.

## 🧱 Add Custom Blocks (Advanced)

-   Extend the block palette configuration.
    
-   Define your own rendering logic and HTML output.
    
-   Register custom block types using the upcoming `registerBlockType` utility.

## ⚙️ Design & Architecture Notes

-   ❌ No nested `DnDContext` – minimizes complexity and keeps drag logic clean.
    
-   🧠 Centralized `handleDragEnd` handler – consistent and easy to manage.
    
-   🎨 CSS Modules used instead of Tailwind – reduces final bundle size.
    
-   🧪 Zustand for state management – lightweight and predictable global store.
    

----------

## 🧩 Limitations

-   🚫 Not yet published as an installable NPM package (but built to support that architecture).
    
-   🎨 Limited style customization per block — currently prioritizing structure over visual theming.
    

----------

## ⚖️ Design Tradeoffs

-   ⚙️ Focused heavily on extensible drag-and-drop mechanics.
    
-   🖋️ Canvas content is edited through an external action pane rather than direct inline text editing.
    

----------

## 🌅 Future Roadmap

-   📝 **Inline Editing on Canvas** – Make blocks fully interactive so users can edit content directly on the canvas.
    
-   📦 **Plugin Packaging** – Bundle and publish as a fully-configured plugin ready for integration into React or Next.js apps.
    
-   🎨 **Style Customization** – Expand support for fine-grained, per-block custom styling (e.g., color pickers, spacing controls).
